    "\n",
    "In 1-dimensional dynamic programming problems, the problem can be broken down into subproblems that depend on one variable. We store the answers to each subproblem using a 1-D array - that is in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming solutions have four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State (Subproblem Definition): The state represents the subproblem we are solving at a specific index or value. In 1-D dynamic programming, this is usually stored in a list, usually named dp or memo by convention, where each index corresponds to a specific subproblem.\n",
    "2. Recurrence Relation (Transition): The recurrence relation describes how the solution to a larger subproblem is constructed from smaller subproblems. This defines the transition between states. This is equivalent to the recursive case in a recursive solution.\n",
    "3. Base Case (Initial Conditions): As with recursion, the base case represents the simplest subproblem, which doesn’t depend on any previous results. This is the starting point from which the dynamic programming list is filled.\n",
    "4. Final Solution: The solution to the overall problem (i.e., the largest subproblem) is typically stored at the last index of the array.\n"
