    "Asymptotic Analysis is a method for measuring the execution time and memory usage of a specific algorithm. It has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity a measurement of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input (the arguments you pass in to your functions!) changes\n",
    "- Space complexity a measurement of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical notation that we use to describe different trends in time and space complexity is called Big O notation. Big O uses the syntax O(...) where inside parentheses is some expression that describes the relationship between the size of an algorithm's input and the complexity of the algorithm.\n",
