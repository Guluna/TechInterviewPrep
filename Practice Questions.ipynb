    "```{tab-item} Problem\n",
    "You are tasked with an intriguing string manipulation problem. You are provided with a string s and an integer K. The string s contains at most 100000100000 alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9) characters and has at least one character. The integer K ranges from 11 to 100000100000, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write a Python function that identifies the length of the longest possible substring within s that contains at most K distinct characters. If multiple substrings share the longest length, you should select the substring that appears first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To offer more clarity, let's consider an example. Suppose s is \"acaabcc\" and K is 2. The longest possible substring with at most 2 distinct characters is \"acaa\", so your function should return 4, which is the length of \"acaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the function should not return the actual substring but the length of the longest possible substring that meets the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
