<h1>Chapter 3: Big-O Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-3-big-o-analysis" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Asymptotic Analysis is a method for measuring the execution time and memory usage of a specific algorithm. It has two components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Time complexity a measurement of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input (the arguments you pass in to your functions!) changes</p></li>
<li><p>Space complexity a measurement of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input changes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The mathematical notation that we use to describe different trends in time and space complexity is called Big O notation. Big O uses the syntax O(…) where inside parentheses is some expression that describes the relationship between the size of an algorithm’s input and the complexity of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Common Big O complexities are summarized below.</p>

<h2>Complexities with Multiple Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#complexities-with-multiple-variables" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We may also encounter time complexities which use variables other than n. One typical scenario for this is when we have multiple inputs, each with variable size, that both affect time complexity.</p>
<p>We could say this algorithm below has an O(m*n) time complexity where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.</p>

<h2>Recursion and Space Complexity<a class="headerlink" href="#recursion-and-space-complexity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The recursion call stack takes up memory! Stacks, including the call stack, are just a special type of list that insert and remove elements in a specific order. We can envision each function call as being an element in a list, which means the number of function calls our functions make affects our function’s space complexity!</p>

<h1>Chapter 5: Dynamic Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-5-dynamic-programming" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic programming is just a fancy term for asking the computer to remember what it has already calculated (a technique known as Memoization).</p>
<section id="d-dynamic-programming">
<h2>1-D Dynamic Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#d-dynamic-programming" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In 1-dimensional dynamic programming problems, the problem can be broken down into subproblems that depend on one variable. We store the answers to each subproblem using a 1-D array - that is in a list.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming solutions have four key components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>State (Subproblem Definition): The state represents the subproblem we are solving at a specific index or value. In 1-D dynamic programming, this is usually stored in a list, usually named dp or memo by convention, where each index corresponds to a specific subproblem.</p></li>
<li><p>Recurrence Relation (Transition): The recurrence relation describes how the solution to a larger subproblem is constructed from smaller subproblems. This defines the transition between states. This is equivalent to the recursive case in a recursive solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Base Case (Initial Conditions): As with recursion, the base case represents the simplest subproblem, which doesn’t depend on any previous results. This is the starting point from which the dynamic programming list is filled.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Solution: The solution to the overall problem (i.e., the largest subproblem) is typically stored at the last index of the array.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We can look at an example of this using the Tribonacci sequence. Similar to the Fibonacci sequence, the nth Tribonacci number is the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence. The mathematical sequence is defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T0 = 0</p></li>
<li><p>T1 = 1</p></li>
<li><p>T2 = 1</p></li>
<li><p>Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n &gt;= 0.</p></li>

<p>The recursive solution is inefficient because it repeatedly solves some of the same subproblems. For example, for the</p>
<p>This solution is inefficent because we repeatedly solve the same subproblems. For example, notice that to find the 5th Tribonacci number tribonacci_recursive(5), we make the function call tribonacci_recursive(2) four separate times.</p>
<img src="./tribonacci.png" alt="tribonacci" style="width:500px;height:400px;">
<p>To eliminate the need for repeated recursive calls on the same problem, we can instead create an array to memoize or store the results to smaller subproblems as we encounter them.</p>
<p>We can define the four components to a dynamic programming solution for Tribonacci as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>State: dp[i] represents the ith Tribonacci number.</p></li>
<li><p>Recurrence Relation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] for i≥3.</p></li>
<li><p>Base Case: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Solution: The final answer is stored in dp[n], where n is the desired Tribonacci number.</p></li>

<p>Dynamic programming solutions are often iterative, solving the smallest problems first, and filling up the dp array incrementally. This is known as a bottom-up approach.</p>
<p>However, dynamic programming can also be done using a recursive approach by passing in the dp array along in each recursive call. This often requires a helper function.</p>
